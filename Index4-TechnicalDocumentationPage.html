Responsive Web Design Projects - Build a Technical Documentation Page
Objective: Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/NdrKKL.
Fulfill the below user stories and get all of the tests to pass. Give it your own personal style.
You can use HTML, JavaScript, and CSS to complete this project. Plain CSS is recommended because that is what the lessons have covered so far and you should get some practice with plain CSS. You can use Bootstrap or SASS if you choose. Additional technologies (just for example jQuery, React, Angular, or Vue) are not recommended for this project, and using them is at your own risk. Other projects will give you a chance to work with different technology stacks like React. We will accept and try to fix all issue reports that use the suggested technology stack for this project. Happy coding!

User Story #1: I can see a main element with a corresponding id="main-doc", which contains the page's main content (technical documentation).
User Story #2: Within the #main-doc element, I can see several section elements, each with a class of main-section. There should be a minimum of 5.
User Story #3: The first element within each .main-section should be a header element which contains text that describes the topic of that section.
User Story #4: Each section element with the class of main-section should also have an id that corresponds with the text of each header contained within it. Any spaces should be replaced with underscores (e.g. The section that contains the header "JavaScript and Java" should have a corresponding id="JavaScript_and_Java").
User Story #5: The .main-section elements should contain at least 10 p elements total (not each).
User Story #6: The .main-section elements should contain at least 5 code elements total (not each).
User Story #7: The .main-section elements should contain at least 5 li items total (not each).
User Story #8: I can see a nav element with a corresponding id="navbar".
User Story #9: The navbar element should contain one header element which contains text that describes the topic of the technical documentation.
User Story #10: Additionally, the navbar should contain link (a) elements with the class of nav-link. There should be one for every element with the class main-section.
User Story #11: The header element in the navbar must come before any link (a) elements in the navbar.
User Story #12: Each element with the class of nav-link should contain text that corresponds to the header text within each section (e.g. if you have a "Hello world" section/header, your navbar should have an element which contains the text "Hello world").
User Story #13: When I click on a navbar element, the page should navigate to the corresponding section of the main-doc element (e.g. If I click on a nav-link element that contains the text "Hello world", the page navigates to a section element that has that id and contains the corresponding header.
User Story #14: On regular sized devices (laptops, desktops), the element with id="navbar" should be shown on the left side of the screen and should always be visible to the user.
User Story #15: My Technical Documentation page should use at least one media query.

#Technology Stack
1. You can use HTML, JavaScript, and CSS to complete this project. Plain CSS is recommended because that is what the lessons have covered so far and you should get some practice with plain CSS. You can use Bootstrap or SASS if you choose. Additional technologies (just for example jQuery, React, Angular, or Vue) are not recommended for this project, and using them is at your own risk. Other projects will give you a chance to work with different technology stacks like React. We will accept and try to fix all issue reports that use the suggested technology stack for this project. Happy coding!
#Content
1. I can see a <main> element with a corresponding id="main-doc", which contains the page's main content (technical documentation).
2. Within the #main-doc ( <main> ) element, I can see several <section> elements, each with a class of "main-section". There should be a minimum of 5.
3. The first element within each .main-section should be a <header> element which contains text that describes the topic of that section.
4. Each <section> element with the class of "main-section" should also have an id comprised of the <header> innerText contained within it, with underscores in place of spaces. The id may include special characters if there are special characters in the respective <header> innerText. (e.g. The <section> that contains the header, "JavaScript & Java", should have a corresponding id="JavaScript_&_Java").
5. The .main-section elements should contain at least 10 <p> elements total (not each).
6. The .main-section elements should contain at least 5 <code> elements total (not each).
7. The .main-section elements should contain at least 5 <li> items total (not each).
8. I can see a <nav> element with a corresponding id="navbar".
9. The navbar element should contain one <header> element which contains text that describes the topic of the technical documentation.
10. Additionally, the navbar should contain link (<a>) elements with the class of "nav-link". There should be one for every element with the class "main-section".
11. The <header> element in the navbar must come before any link (<a>) elements in the navbar.
12. Each element with the class of "nav-link" should contain text that corresponds to the <header> text within each <section> (e.g. if you have a "Hello world" section/header, your navbar should have an element which contains the text "Hello world").
13. When I click on a navbar element, the page should navigate to the corresponding section of the "main-doc" element (e.g. If I click on a "nav-link" element that contains the text "Hello world", the page navigates to a <section> element that has that id and contains the corresponding <header>.
#Layout
1. On regular sized devices (laptops, desktops), the element with id="navbar" should be shown on the left half of the screen. It should always be visible to the user and should remain stationary. You may need to enlarge the viewport or zoom out to ensure the navbar doesn't scroll with the page content.
2. My Technical Documentation page should use at least one media query.

                <article>
                    <p>This chapter introduces the aids to navigation (AtoN) used in the United States. AtoN are devices
                        or marks, both physical and virtual, that assist mariners in determining their vessel’s
                        position, or course, or to warn of dangers, obstructions, or regulatory requirements affecting
                        safe navigation.</p>
                    <p>In the U.S., the Coast Guard is responsible for servicing and maintaining AtoN under federal
                        jurisdiction. This includes both short and long-range navigation systems found in the navigable
                        waters, along the U.S. coast, Intracoastal Waterway (ICW) system, and the Western Rivers system.
                    </p>
                    <p>Lakes and inland waterways that fall under state jurisdiction use the Uniform State Waterway
                        Marking System (USWMS).</p>
                </article>
                <article>
                    <h3>U.S. Aids to Navigation System</h3>
                    <p>Buoys, beacons, and other short-range AtoN are used the same way signs, lane separations, and
                        traffic lights guide motor vehicle drivers. Together, these AtoN make up the short-range AtoN
                        system, which uses charted reference marks to provide information for safely navigating
                        waterways. In the U.S., short-range aids conform to the International Association of Marine
                        Aids to Navigation and Lighthouse Authorities (IALA) Region B. This is called System B, the U.S.
                        Lateral System, or the U.S. Aids to Navigation System. The Coast Guard maintains short-range
                        aids to provide:

                <h3>Lateral and Cardinal Significance</h3>
                <article>
                    <p>Prior to the mid-1970’s, there were over 30 different navigation systems in use around the world.
                        To reduce confusion, IALA established two systems of buoyage for conveying navigation
                        information to mariners. The IALA System A and B were established, with the U.S. complying with
                        the IALA B
                        System.</p>
                    <p>The IALA-A and IALA-B systems use the Lateral and Cardinal Systems to define the conventions of
                        buoyage, and to mark channels with AtoN. “Lateral significance” or “cardinal significance” means
                        that the rules for the Lateral or Cardinal System apply in that instance. However, if something
                        has no lateral or cardinal significance, the respective system’s rules do not apply to the
                        situation. The differences between the markings and conventions used in the Lateral and Cardinal
                        Systems are discussed in the following paragraphs. Table 2-1briefly describes the IALA Systems A
                        and B:</p>
                </article>
                <h3>Lateral System</h3>
                <article>
                    <p>In the lateral system, but route relative to a conventional direction of buoyage (usually
                        upstream). They also mark junctions, a point where two channels meet when proceeding seaward; or
                        bifurcations, the point where a channel divides when proceeding from seaward, or the place where
                        two tributaries meet.</p>
                    <p>In U.S. waters, AtoN use the IALA-B system of lateral marks with few exceptions, arranged in
                        geographic order known as the “conventional direction of buoyage”. Under this, the memory aid 3R
                        rule of “red, right, returning” applies when a vessel is returning from
                        seaward. This means, when returning from sea, keep red markers to the right of the vessel from:
                    <ul>
                        <li>(01) North to south along the Atlantic Coast.</li>
                        <li>(02) South to north and east to west along the Gulf Coast.</li>
                        <li>(03) South to north and east to west along the Pacific Coast.</li>
                        <li>(04) East to west in theGreat Lakes except for Lake Michigan which is north to south.</li>

                <header>U.S AtoN System Variations</header>
                <article>
                    <p>The Uniform State Waterway Marking System (USWMS) is designed for use by many types of operators
                        and small vessels on lakes and inland waterways not shown on nautical charts. The conventional
                        direction of buoyage in the USWMS is considered upstream or towards the head of navigation. This
                        system has two categories of aids:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>(01) System of AtoN compatible with and supplements the U.S. lateral system in states’
                            waters, not federal jurisdiction.</li>
                        <li>(02) System of regulatory markers that warn of danger or provide general information and
                            directions.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Variations</h3>
                    <p>There are three variations to the U.S. AtoN System:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>(01) On a well-defined channel, solid-colored red and black buoys are established in pairs
                            (gate buoys), marking each side of the navigablechannel.</li>
                        <li>(02) The color black is used instead of green.</li>
                        <li>(03) The shape of the buoy has no significance.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Cardinal Marks</h3>
                    <p>When there is no well-defined channel or when there is an obstruction whose nature and location
                        allows it to be approached by a vessel from more than one direction, AtoN with cardinal marks
                        may be used. The USWMS provides for three aids with marks that have cardinal significance:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>(01) A white buoy with a red top represents an obstruction and the buoy should be passed on
                            the south or west.</li>
                        <li>(02) A white buoy with a black top represents an obstruction and the buoy should be passed
                            to the north or east.</li>
                        <li>(03) A red and white vertically striped buoy indicates an obstruction exists between that
                            buoy and the nearest shore.</li>
                    </ul>
